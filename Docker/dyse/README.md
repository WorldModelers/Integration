# DySE Framework Container

This directory builds a container which has DySE installed. You can build it and run examples with:

```
bash start.sh
```

The container will automatically run a Jupyter Notebook server on `port 8888`. You can access this by navigating to: [http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Site_Visit_Demo/a/b/c/API/DySE_tests.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Site_Visit_Demo/a/b/c/API/DySE_tests.ipynb)
