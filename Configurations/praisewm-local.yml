# The following is an example of setting PRAISEWM_DATA_DIRECTORY to a Windows specific
# path.
#
# The 'setx' command will permanently set the variable in your Windows environment.
# You must exit the console window from which you run the commands and run the
# docker-compose command from a new console window so that the variables are
# accessible from the environment:
#    setx COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS 1
#    setx PRAISEWM_DATA_DIRECTORY c:/data/praisewm
# You can use any complete Windows path that you'd like for PRAISEWM_DATA_DIRECTORY
# as long as you have appropriate Windows access permissions, however, you may 
# encounter problems if the path contains spaces. The praisewm server will
# create its directories within PRAISEWM_DATA_DIRECTORY.
#
# For more information see https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/envvars/
