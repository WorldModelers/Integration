Where the number \\nof staff affected is unspecified, one is counted.\\n1 KIK incidents: Any incident that resulted in a staff member being killed, injured or kidnapped. Includes: beaten, kidnapped, killed, missing, \\ntortured, and wounded. \\n\\nIn our coding, assaults describe violence against staff where no specific injuries are reported. Injuries count the number of aid workers explicitly \\ndescribed as having sustained injuries. Most injuries are inflicted with either firearms or explosive weapons. Many assaults are carried out with \\nbody parts (fists, feet) or objects. \\n2 In our coding, an aid worker is defined as an individual employed by or attached to a humanitarian, UN, international, national, or government \\naid agency.\\n\\nKidnapped \\n• 141 aid workers were reportedly kidnapped in 38 incidents in 20 countries. \\n\\n• The highest numbers of kidnappings occurred in the DRC (53), South Sudan (29) and \\nSomalia (16). \\n\\n• Nearly half of the affected aid workers were reportedly kidnapped during road travel \\n(63/141). \\n\\n• In addition, 24 staff were reportedly kidnapped from hotels, NGO compounds and \\nresidences, and project sites.  \\n\\n• 72% of affected aid workers were reportedly released (101/141).\\n• In addition, ransom demands were made for the release of eight aid workers in South \\n\\nSudan and one in CAR; one aid worker escaped from captivity in the DRC and one \\nwas reportedly killed following their abduction in Nigeria. 29 staff members reportedly \\nremain in captivity. \\n\\nAssaulted\\n• 65 aid workers were reportedly assaulted in 56 incidents in 30 countries. \\n\\n• Over 55% of reported incidents were attributed to non-state actors (31/56). State \\nactors were reportedly responsible for two incidents. \\n\\n• Four assaults were reportedly perpetrated by other aid workers and three by \\nbeneficiaries. For 16 incidents, the identify of the perpetrators is unclear. \\n\\n• Over a third of reported aid workers assaults were sustained during armed and \\nunarmed robberies at NGO compounds, guesthouses, offices and warehouses \\n(25/65).\\n\\n• In addition, 14 aid workers were reportedly assaulted during armed and unarmed \\nstreet robberies.\\n\\nAid in Danger Incident Trends \\nKIK | Aid workers killed, injured, kidnapped or assaulted\\n\\n4\\n\\n2017\\n\\nThis overview document presents available information on KIK incidents1 that affected aid agencies and \\ntheir staff.2 The report is based on incidents identified by Insecurity Insight's monitoring of open sources and \\nreported by Aid in Danger partner agencies using the Security in Numbers Database (SiND). \\n\\n\\n\",\n",
